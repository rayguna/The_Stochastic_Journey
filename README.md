A collection of Python codes used to generate the figures in the book is embedded within a Jupyter notebook.
- Figure 1.1. The fraction of head (H) for 1000 tosses of random sampling.
- Figure 1.2: The fraction of heads and tails using the switching strategy for 10,000 coin tosses.
- Figure 2.1. Posterior probability density for the probability of heads after various numbers of coin tosses. Each curve represents the posterior distribution for the probability of heads after a given number of tosses.
